## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important?

  Javascript object notation. It is the standardized way to send data for APIs. Browsers can read it and most languaged have a hash-like structure to work with it.
  
2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord?

3. What's an API?
  Application program interface. When you consume an API you receive data from another site to use. When you host an API you make your data available to users of the API.
  
4. How do we test an internal API (in general)?

  Controller tests. We test that the path works and the response (in JSON) is what we expected.

5. What are two different ways to customize your `json`?
  
  ActiveModel serialers and jbuilder
